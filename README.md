The Story of Magic Events company

The MagicEvents is constantly growing. The manual handling of customers in the
company's office becomes too difficult to be done. The company needs an
automated system that allows customers to do most of the work themselves.

The client registers for events that are visible on the company's website. The
event consists of a title, start/end date, and thumbnail. Once the client gets
registered he receives a manage reservation code that gives him the ability to
manage his registration. The management site should have the ability to cancel a
booking for events that lasts no longer than two days and not later than two days
before the start date.
